README:

The following code is for python 3.

It requires the use of numpy, scipy, pickle, matplotlib, time, IPython.display, glob and skimage libraries.

To speed up the run time, installing fast_histogram from https://github.com/astrofrog/fast-histogram.

It also makes use of Leung-Malik filter bank code from github.com/CVDLBOT/LM_filter_bank_python_code.git which is modified slightly into lm.py file.

Finally, we ackowledge the open-source implementation for the benchmark code from https://github.com/arifqodari/saliencyfilters.

To make everything more manageable, we also created an allMethodsCheck2.py file that we use in our notebook repeatedly.
